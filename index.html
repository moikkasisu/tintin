      <p>This is a fun dream corner for myself during my intensive learning.</p>
      <p>It still has a long way for me to reach my goal - so many things to digest and to practice. </p>
      <p>I met lots of wonderful people here. My instructors are awesome and super nice. They work so hard to keep us engaged and focused, therefore I have to work very hard <p>&#x1F525</p>.<p> This page is also a tribute to them.</p>
      <p>This story is called Flight 714 to Sydney: Tintin, Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus are on their way to Sydney, Australia. Through a chance meeting they are invited to travel on board the private jet of billionaire Lazlo Carreidas...</p>
